## ðŸš©Project Description
> Welcome to the New York Street Tree Census Project! This project, conducted between June and July 2021, aimed to collect and analyze data on street trees in New York City. The dataset includes information on tree species, diameter, and health perception. The project serves a dual purpose: providing valuable insights for residents seeking suitable neighborhoods for living and offering recommendations to government officials on tree planting and conservation strategies.

## ðŸš©Key Objectives

>ðŸŒ³Resident Perspective: For residents, this project helps identify which districts in New York City are more conducive to living based on tree-related insights and recommendations.
>
>ðŸŒ³Government Perspective: From a government standpoint, the project offers guidance on which tree species are more likely to thrive and which are susceptible to challenges, aiding in informed decisions regarding tree planting and conservation efforts.

## ðŸš©Key Objectives

> Data Collection: The project involved collecting data on street trees, including species, diameter, and perceived health status, contains 45 variables and 683,788 observations

> Data Visualization: The analysis began with visualizing the total number of trees planted in New York City's five administrative districts using the R language's ggplot package.

> Health Analysis: The project utilized Tableau to present the distribution of the top six tree health conditions and the health status distribution across each district. This analysis leads to conclusions about which tree species should be prioritized for planting and preservation in each district.

> Interactive Statistics: The project leveraged RStudio and Shiny to conduct statistical analyses and share the findings in an interactive HTML format. It provided insights into the extent of tree damage on different streets in different districts.

> Residential Suitability: Using Tableau mapping, the project visually highlighted streets that are more suitable for residential living based on tree abundance and health status.

## ðŸš©Conclusions and Recommendations

>Through comprehensive data analysis and visualization, this project offers valuable insights into the urban forestry landscape of New York City. It provides guidance for both residents seeking suitable neighborhoods enriched with trees and government officials making informed decisions on tree species planting and conservation. By considering the health and distribution of street trees, this project contributes to creating a greener and more livable city for all.
